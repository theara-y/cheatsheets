    <h1>Object Oriented Programming</h1>
    <p>
        A methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies software development and maintenance by providing some concepts.
    </p>

    <h1>Procedure Oriented Programming</h1>

    <h1>Object</h1>
    <p>
       An object can be anything, tangible or intangible. An object can contain state (attributes) and behavior (methods).
       
       An object can also be defined as an instance of a class, where the object has been initialized and is currently being tracked in computer memory.
    </p>

    <h1>Classes</h1>
    <p>
        A class is a computer document that defines the object; including attribute, methods, initialization logic, and more. It is used as a blueprint to then create instances when the program is run.
    </p>

    <h2>Constructors</h2>
    <p>
        A constructor is a special method within a class which is run when an instance is being created. It is used to perform initialization tasks for the object.
    </p>

    <h1>Inheritance</h1>
    <p>
        Inheritance is a concept in OOP where an object acquires traits(state and behavior) from another a parent object through a parent-child relationship.

        Inheritance provides benefits such as code reuse, specialized objects and method overriding.

        Inheritance is also described as a (child) IS-A (parent) relationship.
    </p>

    <h1>Types of Inheritance</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Single</li>
        <li>Multi-level</li>
        <li>Hierarchical</li>
        <li>Multiple</li>
        <li>Hybrid</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Polymorphism</h1>
    <p>
        Polymorphism is a concept in OOP that focuses on the ability of changing and being adaptive. Examples of polymorphism include using a parent class reference to refer to a child class, method overriding and overloading.
    </p>

    <h1>Encapsulation</h1>
